# UART Implementation on FGPA with System Verilog

The Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) represents one of the most fundamental and widely adopted serial communication protocols. This implementation demonstrates a complete UART communication system designed for FPGA deployment. The UART protocol is simple, reliable, and has minimal hardware requirements, making it suitable for many applications.\\

The UART protocol operates as an asynchronous serial communication standard; so, it does not need a shared clock signal between communicating devices. Data transmission occurs through a predetermined frame structure consisting of a start bit, data payload, optional parity bit, and stop bit(s). Since the clock is not shared, a timing agreement between the transmitter and receiver should be there. It is typically achieved through standardized baud rates such as 9600, 38400, 115200, or higher frequencies, depending on the requirements.\\

Protocol specifications for this implementation follow the standard 8N1 configuration: eight data bits, no parity bit, and one stop bit. Each transmitted frame begins with a start bit (logic low) that signals the beginning of data transmission, followed by eight data bits starting from the LSB, and concludes with a stop bit (logic high) that returns the communication line to its idle state. The idle condition maintains the transmission line at logic high, providing a clear reference for start bit detection. \\
